These directories will hold the weekly lectures in PDF format, as well as example files, code, and data. They will be updated as we go.

The main information repository is the web site, the canvas page and github pages are essentially going to be duplicates of the information. 

Repos will be created for groups and individuals to submit some of the assignments as designated in the particular assignment or project.
